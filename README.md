# connect-four

## Description

Full-stack application that will allows 2 players to run a game of Connect 4 on a 4x4 dimension board.

This application will utilize React on the frontend to handle the actual UI, Express.js on the backend to handle the game logic as well as Rest APIs to track make queries to a postgreSQL database. Users should be able both start a new game as well as quit their current game. We will be using local storage to track the gameId which we will use to grab the current state of that specific game.
